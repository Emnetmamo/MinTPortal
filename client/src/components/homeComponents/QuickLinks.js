       Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) is now universally regarded and recognized as fundamental to achieve sustainable development and economic growth for both developing and developed countries, thus acting as an important driver for poverty alleviation. To set effective STI policies, reliable indicators are needed to benchmark and monitor progress. Research and experimental development (R&D) is an important component of a country’s national innovation system and R&D statistics are among the most widely used indicators to monitor the national innovation system.
Research and experimental Development (R&D) is the term commonly used to describe the activities undertaken by firms and other entities such as individual entrepreneurs in order to create new or improved products and processes. The broadest meaning of the term covers activities from basic scientific research performed in universities and laboratories all the way to testing and refining products before commercial sale or use. R&D comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge (including knowledge of man, culture and society) and the use of this knowledge to devise new applications.
 R&D is located within the innovation systems approach and is recognized as one of the many activities that contribute to innovation. R&D is one among many innovation activities – innovation involves learning, copying, information sharing, training, the transfer of skills, selective hiring of staff, study visits, accessing codified knowledge, design, protecting intellectual property, business intelligence gathering, adaptation of technologies, prototyping, and reverse engineering.
Information on the financial and human resources available to R&D is needed for planning and monitoring, evidence-based decision-making and international benchmarking. Countries that invest in R&D grow their economies, create jobs and have better human development outcomes
